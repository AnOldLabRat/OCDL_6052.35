Hello, my name is Christian Nogueda. 
I'm very excited to learn many crucial skills in these courses i've sighned up for. 
I'm not sure what project i'd like to work on yet but i'm sure that in the end i'll be successful.
My major goal is to create my own products, games, sites, and build an empire of my own.
My ultimate goal is to own my own fortune 500 company based off of what I create.
